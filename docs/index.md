# Third Generation Translation Memory

## Background Reading

This project idea attempts to combine Distributed Ledger Technology with Translation Memory concept to provide a new industry framework, that can promote cross collaboration, industry base standards of processes and greater protection for the individual Translators.

I have outlined my views, thoughts and opinions on what a Translation Memory means. I will be using these views as the basis of my understanding of a Translation Memory throughout this project proposal. [Please read here](./Background/TM "Translation Memory").

I have outlined my views, thoughts and understanding on what Distributed Ledger Technology is. By no means is it a full comprehensive explanation but it will provide enough ground work to understand the proposal. [Please read here](./Background/DLT "Distrubuted Ledger Technology").

## Translation Memory as a Ledger

Lets combine what we know of a translation memory with what we know about ledgers. I will examine what it means for a Translation Memory to be thought of as a ledger of transactions. I will provide a simple example of how a Translation Memory is modelled with transactions and states. I will outline a few areas of expansion beyond the simple example, and how their inclusion adds to what the (simple) Translation Memory can afford.

## Changes to the Translation Industry

Let have a look at one way which the translation industry may change or shift by utilising DLTs, whether to enhance or completely change the workflows.
